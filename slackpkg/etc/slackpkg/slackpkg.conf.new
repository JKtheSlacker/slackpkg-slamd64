# For configuration options that have only two states, possible values are
# either "on" or "off"

# Remember, the only official Slackware ports are x86 and s390, and
# slackpkg developers don't have s390 boxes for testing.  If you are
# testing/using in other archs and have suggestions or patches, 
# please let me know (piterpk@terra.com.br)
#
# Select the architecture of your system
# x86 (the main arch for Slackware)
# 'PKGMAIN' is the name of the directory that contains 'a','ap', ... ,'y'
#ARCH=[i]*[3456x]86
PKGMAIN="slackware"
# x86_64 (Slamd64 and BlueWhite64)
ARCH=x86[_64]* 
#PKGMAIN="slackware"
# PowerPC (Slackintosh)
#ARCH=powerpc
#PKGMAIN="slackware"
# S/390 (Slack/390)
#ARCH=s390
#PKGMAIN="slackware"

# Downloaded files will be in directory below:
TEMP=/var/cache/packages

# Package lists, file lists and others will be at WORKDIR:
WORKDIR=/var/lib/slackpkg

# Special options for wget (default is WGETFLAGS="--passive-ftp")
WGETFLAGS="--passive-ftp"

# If DELALL is "on", all downloaded files will be removed after install.
DELALL=on

# If CHECKPKG is "on", the system will check the md5sums of all packages before
# install/upgrade/reinstall is performed.
CHECKPKG=on

# If CHECKGPG is "on", the system will verify the GPG signature of each package
# before install/upgrade/reinstall is performed.
CHECKGPG=on

# The lines below will set the download priority. 
# Default values: /patches /slackware /extra /pasture /testing
FIRST=patches
SECOND=$PKGMAIN
THIRD=extra
FOURTH=pasture
FIFTH=testing

# The default MAIN is "slackware", but some derived distros use other
# names as the main directory. Of course, MAIN needs to be listed in
# the download priority directories
MAIN=$PKGMAIN

# Enables (on) or disables (off) slackpkg's post-installation features, such
# as checking for new (*.new) configuration files and new kernel images, and
# prompts you for what it should do.  Default=on
POSTINST=on

# Post-installation features, by default, search all /etc for .new files.
# This is the safe option, with that you can't be with thousands of .new
# files without care. Some people don't like this behaviour and wants
# that only the .new files installed in actual slackpkg's session to be
# checked. If this is your case, change it ONLY_NEW_DOTNEW to "on".
# Default=off
ONLY_NEW_DOTNEW=off

# The ONOFF variable sets the initial behavior of the dialog interface.
# If you set this to "on" then all packages will be selected by default.
# If you prefer the opposite option (all unchecked), then set this to "off".
ONOFF=on

# If this variable is set to "on", all files will be downloaded before the
# requested operation (install or upgrade) is performed.   If set to "off",
# then the files will be downloaded and the operation (install/upgrade)
# performed one by one.  Default=off
DOWNLOAD_ALL=off

# Enables (on) or disables (off) the dialog interface in slackpkg.  Default=on
DIALOG=on

# Enables (on) or disable (off) the non-interactive mode. Using that,
# slackpkg will run without ask anything to user, and answering all
# questions with DEFAULT_ANSWER. If you do some upgrade using this mode,
# you'll need to run "slackpkg new-config" later, to find and merge
# .new files.
BATCH=off

# Default answer to slackpkg questions. Can be "y" or "n".
DEFAULT_ANSWER=n

#
# The MIRROR is set from /etc/slackpkg/mirrors
# You only need to uncomment the selected mirror. 
# Uncomment one mirror only.
