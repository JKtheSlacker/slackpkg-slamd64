  Slackpkg is a tool for those who want to easily install or upgrade packages 
  via the network.  With slackpkg, you can have a minimal installation of 
  Slackware Linux and install/upgrade only those  packages you need most.

  You don't need to setup NFS or make dozens of CDs for all your computers; 
  all you need to do is to type one command and all the latest official 
  Slackware packages will be at your fingertips.

  For more information about slackpkg, see its man pages:
    man 8 slackpkg
    man 5 slackpkg.conf
