Porting Slackpkg, the Slackware remote package manager,
for use on Slamd64 is non-trivial.  With this in mind,
here is a tree containing my working ported tree, and
also a tool to take a standard slackpkg package from
Slackware and automatically port it for use on Slamd64.

As of this writing, this script is known to work on 
Slackpkg 2.70.5.
