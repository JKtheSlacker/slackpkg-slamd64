Porting Slackpkg, the Slackware remote package manager,
for use on Slamd64 is non-trivial.  With this in mind,
here is a tree containing my working ported tree, and
also a tool to take a standard slackpkg package from
Slackware and automatically port it for use on Slamd64.

As of this writing, this script is known to work on 
Slackpkg 2.70.5.

I've also added a new directory, beta/.  This contains
slackpkg 2.71beta2, as ported for Slamd64.  Feel free
to run makepkg on this directory and give it a try.
portslackpkg will continue to be aimed for full
releases as seen in Slackware.
